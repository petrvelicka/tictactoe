# TicTacToe

a game of tictactoe lol

## How to run

you'll need to have a go compiler bruh, it should be reasonably new.

then open a terminal (or if you are on mustdieOS, it's called `cmd.exe`) and run `go run main.go` or to get an executable `go build`.

## How to play

when the game asks you to play, just input you preferred field to play in the format of `R C` where `R` is the row and `C` is the column.

if you don't have a friend to play with you, you can just play with a random number generator. Just type `y` when the game asks you to.
